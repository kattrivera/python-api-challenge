    <h3><strong>API Homework</strong></h3><br>

    <h2>WeatherPy</h2><br>
    <p>Using cityPy, lat and long coordinates were picked at random and output cities and stored into a .csv. The cities were used to get weather info from openweathermap.com.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The following scatterplots were created to see if there are relationships between the latitude and the weather condition:</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li>Temperature (F) vs. Latitude</li>
    <li>Humidity (%) vs. Latitude</li>
    <li>Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude</li>
    <li>Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude</li></ul><br>

    <p>Further, the locations were split into northern and southern hemisphere to see if there were any additional patterns/relationships to uncover:</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li>Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude</li>
    <li>Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude</li>
    <li>Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude</li>
    <li>Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude</li>
    <li>Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude</li>
    <li>Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude</li>
    <li>Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude</li>
    <li>Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude</li></ul><br>

    <h2>VacationPy</h2>
    <p>From the above .csv, ideal weather conditions were used to filter the cities. Google Maps was used to create a heat map.</p><br>

    <p>Also, Google Places API was used to search cities with the ideal weather conditions for the closest hotel within 5000m. Google Maps was used to create a map of hotel locations.</p>
